There are two general ways this could be implemented, either with a dynamic map using some service and API calls or a static map with all the logic managed on our server side.
We found several services that offer dynamic map services and APIâ€™s, but none of them were free. Google maps has an API that we believe will work for the project, but it will only service 28,500 API calls a month before billing us and payment information is required beforehand.
Given the current scope and budget of this project, we settled on a static map. The issue is each task requires geographic coordinates and we would have to get those coordinates from each task and pinned on a map in some way that allows it to be resized for different sized devices while the pins stay where you expected.
We believe we will be able to anchor the pins to the image in such a way that they are moved and scaled along with the map. We are planning to implement a feature that automatically maps the latitude and longitude coordinates associated with each task onto coordinates connected to the static map using relative offsets.
